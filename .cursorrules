# Cursor AI Rules for FitTravel

## CRITICAL: No Hallucinating About Technology Availability

You MUST verify before claiming any technology, API, or AI model doesn't exist or isn't available.

### Mandatory Verification Process
1. **NEVER** claim an AI model "doesn't exist" or "isn't available" without web verification
2. **ALWAYS** search the web when uncertain about current technology state
3. **REMEMBER** your knowledge has a cutoff date - technology evolves rapidly

### Current AI Model Reality (verify for updates)
- Gemini 2.0 Flash - EXISTS and available
- Gemini 2.5 Flash - EXISTS and available (this project uses it)
- Gemini 2.5 Pro - EXISTS and available
- GPT-4o, o1, o1-mini - EXIST and available
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus 4.5 - EXIST and available

### This Project's AI Stack
- **Model:** Gemini 2.5 Flash (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **Integration:** Supabase Edge Functions
- **Location:** `supabase/functions/cairo_guide/`, `supabase/functions/egypt_fitness_guide/`

### Before Suggesting Changes to AI Code
1. Check what model is currently configured
2. Verify the suggested model exists via web search
3. Check Google AI documentation for current model IDs and capabilities
4. Do not downgrade models without explicit user request

## Code Patterns

### Flutter Services
- Extend ChangeNotifier
- Use Provider for dependency injection
- Follow patterns in `lib/services/`

### Edge Functions
- TypeScript/Deno runtime
- API keys in environment variables
- Follow patterns in `supabase/functions/`

### UI/UX
- Dark luxury aesthetic
- Gold primary color
- Mobile-first, 60fps target
- Haptic feedback on key actions

## Key Reminders

1. Default location is Cairo (30.0444, 31.2357), not SLC
2. All data persists to Supabase, not local storage
3. Photos compress to 1920px max before upload
4. Edge Functions handle all external API calls for security
